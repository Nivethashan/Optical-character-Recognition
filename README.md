# Optical-character-Recognition
Proposed a novel algorithm for Optical Character Recognition to convert the Tamil language text available in image format to text format and implemented using MATLAB.
The training and test images are collected and pre-processed by Binarization and Normalization and each character is then located and segmented. To classify the characters from the image, Statistical distance classifier and the feature extraction techniques such as Euler number, projection and moments are used.
